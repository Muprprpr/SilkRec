## 🚀 Introduction

**SilkRec** (formerly project smoothScreen) is a Windows screen recording tool built for creators who want high-quality tutorials without the hassle of video editing. 

Traditional screen recorders capture the whole screen, making text hard to read. **SilkRec** intelligently detects your cursor position and activities, applying **butter-smooth automatic zooms** (inspired by tools like Screen Studio) in real-time. It makes your recordings look like they were professionally edited, straight out of the box.

> "It's like having a cameraman inside your cursor."

## ✨ Key Features

* **🎥 Intelligent Auto-Zoom**: Automatically zooms in on active areas (e.g., when you are typing or clicking menus) so your viewers never miss a detail.
* **🍫 Silky Smooth Easing**: Uses advanced interpolation algorithms to ensure camera movements are fluid and natural, eliminating shaky or jerky cursor tracking.
* **🪟 Windows Native**: Optimized specifically for Windows workflows.
* **⚡ Zero Post-Production**: What you record is what you get. Save hours of editing time on zooming and panning keyframes.
* **🎯 Smart Focus**: Detects focused windows and UI elements to keep the framing perfect.

## 🛠️ How It Works

SilkRec monitors your mouse coordinates and input events (clicks, keystrokes). Instead of a static capture, it creates a virtual "camera" that glides across your screen.

We use **Bezier curve smoothing** to ensure that when the camera follows your mouse, it accelerates and decelerates naturally—giving it that signature "Silk" feel.
